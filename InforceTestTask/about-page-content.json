Generates a unique SHA-256 hash using:\n   - Original URL\n   - Random GUID (for uniqueness)\n   - Current timestamp\n3. Encodes the first 6 bytes as Base64\n4. Replaces unsafe characters:\n   - \u0027/\u0027 becomes \u0027_\u0027\n   - \u0027\u002B\u0027 becomes \u0027-\u0027\n5. Removes trailing \u0027=\u0027 characters\n6.
